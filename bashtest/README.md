# bashtest 
My first look at bash scripting

## What I learned:
- What a shebang is and how it is used - #!
- Variable declaration and use syntax - NAME=Tyler - $NAME 
- Use of echo command - echo "Tyler" - echo $NAME
- Use of read command - read TYLER
- Positional arguments - My name is $NAME
- Changing permissions using chmod command - * chmod  u/g/o +/- r/w/x \<filename>
