Task 1: File Management and Text Processing

**Task Name:** File Organizer

**Description:** Create a bash script that organizes files in a specified directory. The script should categorize files based on their extensions into different subdirectories. Additionally, it should create a log file that lists all the files and their corresponding categories.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Files organized into subdirectories based on their extensions.
- A log file containing the original file names and their categories.

**Optional Extras:**
- Allow the script to take the target directory as a command-line argument.
- Implement error handling for cases where the target directory doesn't exist.

**Test Data (JSON):**
```json
{
  "directory": "/path/to/target/directory",
  "files": [
    "file1.txt",
    "file2.png",
    "file3.doc",
    "file4.txt",
    "file5.png"
  ]
}
```
