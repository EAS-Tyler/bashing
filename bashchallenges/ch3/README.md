# Task 3: Data Parsing and Manipulation

The task was to write a bash script that processes a CSV file, performs operations like filtering or sorting, and outputs the result to a new CSV file.

## What I did:
I created a bash script (parseappend.sh) that asked the user what information they require (using "read" command) from a set of test data (data.csv), and then had the script append this to a file (newdata.csv). 

I successfully processed a CSV file to output desired information using the "echo" function to ask the user what information they would like, and then the "read" function to receive this information, in the form of a variable. After this, I used if / elif statements to parse the test data using the conditions of the user input, and appended the desired information to a new file.

## What I learned:
- If statement syntax in bash script 
- The use of the && operator
- The use of "head" and "tail" commmands, and also acknowledged other methods of parsing data
